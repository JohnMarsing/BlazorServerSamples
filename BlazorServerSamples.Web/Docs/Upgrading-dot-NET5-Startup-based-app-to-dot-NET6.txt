> Most of the questions are around the "minimal hosting" changes, and "minimal APIs", and what that means for their existing .NET 5 apps.
> For the new `WebApplication` and `WebApplicationBuilder` types suggest looking at the [second post in this series](https://andrewlock.net/exploring-dotnet-6-part-2-comparing-webapplicationbuilder-to-the-generic-host/).

Typical minimal `Program.cs`
```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();
app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");
app.Run();
```
